A contiguous subarray is a subarray (a portion of an array) in which the elements 
are adjacent to each other. In other words, all elements in a contiguous subarray 
are located consecutively within the original array. Here's an example:

Consider the following array:

```python

original_array = [2, 4, -3, 5, -6, 7, 8]

```

Now, let's take some contiguous subarrays from this array:

1. The subarray `[2, 4, -3]` is a contiguous subarray because all its elements are 
adjacent within the original array.

2. The subarray `[5, -6, 7]` is another contiguous subarray. It starts at index 3 
(`original_array[3]` is 5) and includes the next two elements, which are adjacent.

3. The subarray `[7, 8]` is also a contiguous subarray. It starts at index 5 
(`original_array[5]` is 7) and includes the next element.

In each of these examples, the elements in the subarray are consecutive within the 
original array, making them contiguous subarrays.
