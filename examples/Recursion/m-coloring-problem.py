# M â€“ Coloring Problem
# Problem Statement: Given an undirected graph and a number m, determine if the graph can be 
# colored with at most m colors such that no two adjacent vertices of the graph are colored with the same color.

# Example 1:
# Input: 
# N  4 = nodes
# M = 3
# E = 5
# Edges[] = {
#   (0, 1),
#   (1, 2),
#   (2, 3),
#   (3, 0),
#   (0, 2)
# }

# Output: 1

# Explanation: It is possible to colour the given graph using 3 colours.

# Example 2:

# Input: 
# Nodes => N = 3
# Colors => M = 2
# Edges => E = 3
# Edges[] = {
#   (0, 1),
#   (1, 2),
#   (0, 2)
# }

# Output: 0
