# You are given a string word containing lowercase English letters.

# Telephone keypads have keys mapped with distinct collections of lowercase English letters,
# which can be used to form words by pushing them. For example, the key 2 is mapped with
# ["a","b","c"], we need to push the key one time to type "a", two times to type "b", and
# three times to type "c".

# It is allowed to remap the keys numbered 2 to 9 to distinct collections of letters. The keys
# can be remapped to any amount of letters, but each letter must be mapped to exactly one
# key. You need to find the minimum number of times the keys will be pushed to type the string word.

# Return the minimum number of pushes needed to type word after remapping the keys.
# An example mapping of letters to keys on a telephone keypad is given below. Note that 1,
# *, #, and 0 do not map to any letters.
