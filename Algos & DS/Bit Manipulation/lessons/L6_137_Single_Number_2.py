  nums[i] will go to ones, if not in twos
  nums[i] will go to twos, if it is in ones
  nums[i] will go to threes, if it is in twos
  
  
  ones = (ones ^ num) & ~twos
  twos = (twos ^ num) & ~ones
  
  1. Intialize:
  ones = 0, twos = 0
  
  2. First 2:
  - ones = (0 ^ 2) & ~0 = 2 & -1 = 2 (binary:10)
  - twos = (0 ^ 2) & ~2 = 2 & -3 = 2 (binary:00)
  
  3. Second 2:
  - ones = (2 ^ 2) & ~0 = 0 & -1 = 0 (binary:00)
  - twos = (0 ^ 2) & ~0 = 2 & -1 = 2 (binary:10)
  
  4. Third 2:
  - ones = (0 ^ 2) & ~2 = 2 & -3 = 0 (binary:00)
  - ones = (2 ^ 2) & ~0 = 0 & -1 = 0 (binary:00)
  
  5. First 3: 
  - ones = (0 ^ 3) & ~0 = 3 & -1 = 3 (binary: 11)
  - twos = (0 ^ 3) & ~3 = 3 & -4 = 0 (binary: 00)
  
  6. Result:
  - ones = 3, which is the single number
  
  Why this works:
  * XOR operator toggles bits between 0 and 1.
  * The & ~twos and & ~ones ensures that bits are only added to ones or twos if they haven't been seen twince or once, respectively.
  * After three ocurrences, the bits are rest to 0 in both ones and twos.
  
  
  Step	Num	ones (binary)	twos (binary)
  0	     -	00	          00
  1	     2	10	          00
  2	     2	00	          10
  3	     2	00	          00
  4	     3	11	          00
  
  ones:
  - Tracks bits that have appeared an odd number of times
  - If a bit is set to 1, in ones it means that the bit has appeared once in the numbers processed so far.
  twos:
  - Tracks bits that have appeared twice so far.
  - If a bit is set to 1 in twos, it means that bit has appeared twice in the numbers processed so far.
