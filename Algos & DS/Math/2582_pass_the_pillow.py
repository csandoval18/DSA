# There are n people standing in a line labeled from 1 to n. 
# The first person in the line is holding a pillow initially. 
# Every second, the person holding the pillow passes it to the next person standing in the line. 
# Once the pillow reaches the end of the line, the direction changes, 
# and people continue passing the pillow in the opposite direction.

# For example, once the pillow reaches the nth person they pass it to the n-1'th person, then to the n-2'th person and so on.

# Given the two positive integers n and time, return the index of the person holding the pillow after time seconds.

# To simulate a cycle using modulo, you can use the modulus operation to "wrap around" indices. 
# This is particularly useful in scenarios like the "Pass the Pillow" game, where 
# the pillow is passed around in a circular manner.

# Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation of how you can use modulo to simulate this cycle:

# 1. Define the Total Number of Players: Let's say there are N players.
# 2. Define the Current Position: Let's say the pillow is currently with player at position current_pos (using 0-based indexing).
# 3 .Define the Number of Passes: Let's say you want to pass the pillow T times.

# The new position after T passes can be calculated using the formula:

# new_pos = (current_pos + T) % N

def pass_the_pillow(n: int, )


# n = 4
# time = 5
n = 18
time = 38

# Output: 2
s = Solution()
print("ans:", s.passThePillow(n, time))

# People pass the pillow in the following way: 
# 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2
# After 5 seconds, the 2nd person is holding the pilllow.
