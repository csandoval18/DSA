Why check up to sqrt(n) inclusive?

# To check if a number `n` has prime factors, testing up to `sqrt(n)` is sufficient.  
# If `n` has a factor `a > sqrt(n)`, the corresponding factor `b = n/a` must be `<= sqrt(n)`.  
# If no factors `<= sqrt(n)` exist, `n` cannot be composite (its smaller factor would already have been found).  
# This reduces the search space, optimizing primality checks and sieve-based algorithms like Sieve of Eratosthenes.

11^(1/2) = 3.31
4*4 = 16 > 11
3.5*3.5 = 12.25 > 11
