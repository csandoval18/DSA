# Recursive Thought Process

# - Task: Find the longest subsequence of words where no two consecutive words belong to the same group.
# 1. For each word at index i, we have two choices:
#   * Include the word in our subsequence if its group is different from the previous word's group.
#   * Skip the word an d try to find the solution for the remaining words.
# 2. The base case is when we have only one word left, which can always be included in the subsequence.

# Recursive Function
# Letâ€™s define a recursive function findLongest(i, prev_group):

# * i is the current index of the word we are considering.
# * prev_group is the group of the last word we included in the subsequence.
# * The function will return the length of the longest valid subsequence starting from the i-th word, given that the previous word belongs to prev_group.

# Recursive Formula:
# Case 1: Include the current word words[i] if groups[i] != prev_group:
#   In this case, the answer is 1 + findLongest(i + 1, groups[i]).
# Case 2: Skip the current word:
#   The answer is findLongest(i + 1, prev_group).

# The overall result will be the maximum of these two cases:
# findLongest(i, prev_group) = max(
#     1 + findLongest(i + 1, groups[i]) if groups[i] != prev_group else 0,
#     findLongest(i + 1, prev_group)
# )
