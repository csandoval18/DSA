'''
Given an integer n, return the count of all numbers with unique digits, x, where 0 <= x < 10^n.
'''

'''
Approach:

1. Recursive backtracking:
  * Use a recursive function to explore numbers digit-by-digit, backtracking whenever a digit repeats.
  * Start with an initial set of unused digits from 0 to 9.
  * For each recursive call, choose an unused digit, add it to the current number, and continue.
  * If the currennt number reaches n digits (or less, if counting all numbers with fewer digits is allowed), count it as a valid number.
2. Base case:
  * When reaching n digits, stop further recursion.
3. Backtracking: 
  * After exploring one possibility with a chosen digit, remove it from the current combination and try the next available digit.

# helper(pos, used):
# pos = The number of remaining position to fill.
# used = a list tracking whic digits are currently in use.
# When pos == 0, the recursion has generated a valid unique number, so it return 1

# Backtracking:
# For each digit from start to 9, if digit is unused (not used[digit]) mark it as used and recurse to the next position.
# After the recursive call, unmark digit to try other digits in its place (backtracking)

# TC: O(10^n) due to recursively exploring each possible digit
# SC: O(n) we use an array of size 10 for used digits and recursive digit
